# Welcome to Intermediate R

We are very excited you could make it to this Intermediate R workshop!  __________ <!-- Something about expectations of what people know when they enter the workshop. --> We hope to leave this workshop with some ________.

## What is the scope of this workshop?

As we've continued learning and working with R, we find ourselves needing to do more data preparation and organizing our R code.  We will work together today to iteratively assess and clean messy data by:

<!-- The order of this will definitely change. -->

  1. De-duping data
  1. (i dunno how to describing matching strings that should be the same...? regexp stuffs)
  1. Working with different data types
  1. Handling missing data
  1. Reshaping data row by row
  1. Adjusting for outliers

Afterwards, we will reorganize our code for use with other datasets.  By doing so, we learn how to:

  1. Debug
  1. Examine source code
  1. Write functions
  1. Organize code for flexibilty and readability
  1. Make an R package

Practicing this process of cleaning data together exposes us to programming concepts within R.  With a foundation in these concepts, we can _________  <!-- Some nice conclusion about concrete things attendees will be able to do by re-applying what they learn today. -->.
